# Roke

A Wasp starter with sensible defaults.

## What's he building in there?

I built Roke because I was tired of repeating the same setup ritual for every
new Wasp project. Instead of continuing that cycle, I created the starting point
I always wished I had.

This isn't just another blank slate. It's a thoughtfully crafted foundation that
includes:

- Preconfigured shadcn/ui components
- Motion animation presets
- Helper scripts for common tasks
- Real-world examples beyond the basics
- Best practices baked in

## Philosophy

While most starters give you an empty canvas, Roke provides opinionated defaults
that reflect how modern web apps are actually built. It embraces shadcn/ui's
principles of being "Accessible. Customizable. Open Source." and extends them to
the entire project structure.

The goal isn't just to give you boilerplate - it's to provide a foundation that
makes web development more enjoyable and accessible. Batteries included, but
replaceable.
