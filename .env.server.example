# ==========================================
# PRODUCTION READINESS CHECKLIST (Plaid)
# ==========================================
# Before going to production, ensure:
#
# 1. Data Retention Compliance:
#    ✓ /item/remove is called when users delete institutions or accounts
#    ✓ Implemented in deleteInstitution and deleteUserAccount actions
#
# 2. Re-authentication Flow (Update Mode):
#    ✓ Users can reconnect when credentials expire (ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED)
#    ✓ createUpdateModeLinkToken action handles re-authentication
#    ✓ Institutions have status field to track connection state
#
# 3. User Consent Flow:
#    ✓ Users are shown consent dialog before connecting banks
#    ✓ Dialog explains data collection and usage
#    ✓ Implemented in PlaidConsentDialog component
#
# 4. Webhook Configuration:
#    ✓ PLAID_WEBHOOK_URL points to your production domain
#    ✓ Webhook verification is enabled (JWT-based, automatic)
#    ✓ Webhooks trigger automatic transaction syncing
#
# 5. Environment Variables:
#    ✓ PLAID_ENV=production
#    ✓ PLAID_SECRET uses production secret key
#    ✓ PLAID_WEBHOOK_URL uses HTTPS production URL
#
# 6. Security:
#    ✓ ENCRYPTION_KEY is secure and never committed to git
#    ✓ All Plaid access tokens are encrypted at rest
#    ✓ HTTPS enforced in production
