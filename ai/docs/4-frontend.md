# Phase 4: Frontend Development

## Summary of Progress

### Dashboard Core Components

- **`DashboardPage.tsx` Created:**
    - Established the main entry point for the authenticated user dashboard at `src/dashboard/DashboardPage.tsx`.
    - Currently renders the `SpendingMetrics` component.

- **`SpendingMetrics` Component (`src/dashboard/components/spending-metrics.tsx`):**
    - Fetches spending summary data using the `getSpendingSummary` query (`useQuery` hook).
    - Displays spending totals for "Today", "This Week", and "This Month".
    - Includes percentage change calculation and display (comparing to the previous period) based on the updated `getSpendingSummary` query results.
    - Implements loading state placeholders and basic error handling for the query.
    - Uses `framer-motion` for basic animations.
    - Uses `lucide-react` for icons.

### Development Notes & Next Steps

- **Subscription Checks Deferred:** Implementation of subscription status checks (`getUserSubscriptionStatus` query) to restrict access is currently **deferred** until after core frontend features are built. Stripe integration (Phase 5) will follow Phase 4.
- **Styling:** Basic styling is applied using Tailwind CSS classes and conventions from `shadcn/ui` (e.g., `text-muted-foreground`).
- **Temporary Landing Page UI:** UI elements for displaying spending summaries added to `LandingPage.tsx` during Phase 3 were for temporary testing and are not part of the final dashboard structure. The focus is now on building out components within the `src/dashboard/` directory.
- **Next:** Implement components for displaying Monthly Spending and Category Spending breakdowns on the `DashboardPage`. Integrate a charting library for visualizing monthly trends.
