# TypeScript

**Description**: Guidelines for TypeScript usage and type safety **Applies to**:
`src/**/*.{ts,tsx}`

## General

- Define proper types for all variables and functions
- Use type inference when types are obvious
- Use .tsx extension for React components
- Use .ts extension for non-React files
- Define proper types for operations:
  - ✓ `type GetTasks = QueryFn<void, Task[]>`
  - ✓ `type CreateTask = ActionFn<{ description: string }, Task>`

## Type Definitions

- Place shared types in the same file they will be used in.
- Use interface for object types that can be extended
- Use type for unions, intersections, and mapped types
